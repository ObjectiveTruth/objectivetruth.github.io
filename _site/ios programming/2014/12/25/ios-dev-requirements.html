    <h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>

<p>After searching far and wide, it was tough to find an up to date guide
on what I should buy. Here&#39;s everything I ended up buying and I&#39;ll
explain why below:</p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/buy-mac/mac-mini" title="Mac Mini">Mac Mini - $749.00</a></p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/buy-ipod/ipod-touch/16gb-space-grey" title="ipod touch 16GB">iPod Touch - $219.00</a></p>

<p>Developer Account License - $ 99.00 / year</p>

<h2>Mac Mini</h2>

<p>You&#39;re going to need at least 8GB of Ram, and because Apple doesn&#39;t let
you upgrade you need to buy this from them at a crazy 100$ for 4 GB to
8GB upgrade, so you might as well go with the middle of the ground Mac
Mini. Its 200$ more but if you&#39;re going to upgrade to 8GB from the base
model anyways, its very worth it.</p>

<h3>Why do you need so much RAM?</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever done development, you know you&#39;re going to have a lot of
big files open, this will each up your RAM like woah. 8GB is a good
balance that will make your compile times much faster in the long run</p>

<h2>iPod Touch:</h2>

<p><strong>DON&#39;T buy an old one from Kijiji</strong></p>

<p>The current gen as of writing is the 5th gen iPod Touch. iPods aren&#39;t
refreshed as fast as iPhones, so this is like an iPhone 4S which is
pretty old right now. </p>

<p>If you were to get a 4th gen iPod Touch of Kijiji
for like 100\$, its wayyy old and won&#39;t support iOS 7 or 8 (i know
right???). Unfortunately, there&#39;s rumors of an iPod Touch refresh coming
in a few months but I can&#39;t wait that long so I plopped down the \$219
now. Even if you get a used iPod 5th gen, it just won&#39;t be the same and
the ones initially released 2 years ago don&#39;t have a camera, the new
ones you buy have a camera.</p>

<p>To be honest, I hate this thing, its so slow and knowing I paid full
price for a 2-3 year old product makes me sick, but its the cheapest
option.</p>

<p><strong>Just do it</strong></p>

<h2>Developer Account License</h2>

<p>You need this to debug your app on a physical device.</p>

<p>I know.. it SUCKS big time. WTF Apple??</p>

<p>The good news</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a student you can see if your educational institute is part of
Apple&#39;s Education plan which is free and gives its students free
developer accounts as long as they&#39;re students.</p>

<p>Thankfully for me, University of Ontario Institute of Technology is part
of the program, however I have to wait until school starts in a few
weeks to join.</p>

<p>For now, the Emulator and i are going to be good friends.</p>
