    <h2>You Need a Game Plan</h2>

<p>When I made my first app, I took the naive approach of just starting to
code and figuring it out as I went.</p>

<p>This is an absolutely retarded way to work</p>

<p>But, I would recommend it for anyone new to building an app or any
project</p>

<p>Having gone through that train wreck of an experience and spending
countless hours refactoring code over and over, I will say Design is
absolutely paramount.</p>

<h2>Visual Design</h2>

<p>This is why most companies have a design team.</p>

<p>You do not want to keep remaking GUIs in code. It is MUCH easier to move
a button a few pixels in Photoshop or even in Paint than in a live
environment.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the visual design mockup I ended up with.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.objectivetruth.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/macUoitDCBooking_mainscreen-e1420300531473-651x1024.png" alt="macUoitDCBooking_mainscreen"></p>

<p>Looks really cruddy but I&#39;ll explain a few important details I wrestled with:</p>

<h3>Hamburger Menu @ Top Left</h3>

<p>Android uses these heavily but its not common in Apple.</p>

<p>The problem is how do you put a menu so that you can access more
features, without &quot;hiding&quot; too far from a user&#39;s reach?</p>

<p>I settled on this because the other features aren&#39;t used very often and
if the user needs them they will hunt. I kept the important features
front and center</p>

<h3>Information Button and My Account Button @ Bottom</h3>

<p>Apple loves Tab Toolbars which, is why their iPhones are so long. I
personally hate this design because it uses a lot of screen real estate
to keep these guys on screen ALL the time.</p>

<p>Regardless you have to think of your target audience. If you&#39;re use to
Apple&#39;s design philosphy, this will seem normal so I decided to put
these features down here instead of at the top like the android version.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Logo @ Bottom Center</h3>

<p>I wanted to incorporate the Logo in somewhere and this was the most
appropriate way according to apple.</p>

<p>The best design is the one you don&#39;t notice (because its so simple)
  </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Technical Design</h2>

<p>This is so important but really only makes sense once you&#39;ve been in
the trenches and seen how things actually work. With my experience in
android I know how MVC (model, view, controller) design philosophy works
and I know what to expect.</p>

<p>In my mind I already have an idea of where certain code is going without
having to power my way through it unknowing.</p>
