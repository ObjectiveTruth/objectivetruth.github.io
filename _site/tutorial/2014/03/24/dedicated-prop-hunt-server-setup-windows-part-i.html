    <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thanks to many popular gaming channel including SeaNanners people
have been looking for a way to setup a server and get in on
the fun. What got me into it was Prop-Hunt and setting it up wasn&#39;t
quite so easy, but once it was done, it was hilarious the
amount of fun you can have. I figure a guide would be good
since all the guides I found were outdated and had alot of
quirks you had to find out on your own.</p>

<p>I broke this up into 2 sections, <strong>theory</strong> and <strong>practical</strong>. If it were me
reading this I would jump into practical and only when I got stuck would
I read the theory to figure out what </p>

<p>I did wrong. It&#39;ll take some patience but once you get it working, its a hilariously good
time!</p>

<h2>Practical - Windows Dedicated Gmod Server</h2>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download SteamCMD from the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD" title="SteamCMD - Valve Developer Community Page">Valve Developer Community
Page (you can read about it using that link) or here&#39;s
the</a>direct
link to the windows file</p></li>
<li><p>Extract the files into whatever folder in your C drive (I put mine
in <code>c:\steamcmd</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>steamcmd.exe</code> and wait for everything to load and give you a
prompt</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>login anonymous</code> without the quotes</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>force\install\dir C:\</code> will be where the GmodDedicated Server will go (I did <code>c:\GmodDS</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Type <code>app\update 4020 validate</code> and wait for it to install (can take like an hour, depending on internet
connection speed).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can close steamcmd it once its done</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the Prop Hunt server files from <a href="https://github.com/xspacesoft/PropHunt" title="xspacesoft PropHunt GitHub">github
or use
this</a>direct
link</p></li>
<li><p>When you extract the files from step 7, you will see 2 folders,
sounds and gamemodes (ignore the other files, that&#39;s used for github
stuff). Extract the 2 folders so they reside in
<code>c:\garrysmod\</code> (from step 5). In my case the sounds and gamemods
directory ended up in <code>c:\GmodDS\garrysmod\</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The sounds and gamemodes file structure should look something like this(murder and terrortown are gamemodes I added after along with other sounds)</p>

<img src="http://www.objectivetruth.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gamemodes_file_structure_gmodDS1.png" alt="gamemodes\_file\_structure\_gmodDS"></p>

<ol>
<li>Make a shortcut for <code>srcds.exe</code> (its in the directory from step 5),
and click properties on the shortcut you just made.</li>
</ol>

<p>add the following after <code>srcds.exe -game garrysmod  +gamemode prophunt</code></p>

<p><img src="http://www.objectivetruth.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/srcds_shortctu_properties_prop_hunt.png" alt="srcds\_shortctu\_properties\_prop\_hunt"></p>

<ol>
<li>Run the shortcut, edit what you like, and press Start
Server: Voila! Dedicated Server up and Running. Below are a
few Frequently asked questions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Friends can&#39;t see and/or join my server</li>
</ul>

<p>This is almost for sure because of port issues. 2 options (A) read a basic networking book or (B) go to portforwarding.com</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to I setup a password for my server
Check out my 4nd part to this guide</p></li>
<li><p>I can&#39;t pickup props as Hunter or turn on my flashlight
Check out my 4rth part to this guide</p></li>
<li><p>How do I add new maps, do more advanced features?
Check out my 2nd part to this guide</p></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Theory (more advanced)</h2>

<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>What is Gmod? </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a completely stand alone game that just happens to be made as a mod of Half-Life.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is Prop-Hunt? </li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a mod (gamemode) of Gmod.</p>

<p>Completely dissociate Half-Life and Gmod in your head, because it
screwed me up when trying to figure out how to setup the server.\</p>

<p>You are running a Gmod Server which allows multiple
gamemodes, one of which is Prop-Hunt (sandbox is the standard
Gmod gamemode).</p>

<p>Each type of mod requires certain files and go into particular
directories:\</p>

<ul>
<li><p>sounds = <code>\sounds\</code></p></li>
<li><p>gamemodes = <code>\gamemodes\</code></p></li>
<li><p>maps = <code>\maps\</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Steam workshop downloads files and puts them in packages (like a .zip)
called addons. Makes it easier to add/remove.</p>

<p>So if you want to add something to the server you have to either
extract the files and put them in the appropriate directory
or get an auth key (I&#39;ll show that in part II)</p>

<p>In the steam workshop (as of writing this) there are 2-3 different
PropHunt versions. The gitHub link above is meant to be for the most
actively updated one and the one I think is the best. Also,
you&#39;re getting it right from github, so its always up to
date. I&#39;ll put it in another guide on how to keep
things updated.</p>
