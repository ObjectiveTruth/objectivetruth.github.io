<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>After lots of trouble shooting and seeing the above screen for the
millionth time I&#39;m comfortable enough to post up the fairly stable
version of the UOITLibraryBooking app i&#39;ve been working on.</p>

<p>Tons of hurdles I&#39;ve had to go through and still many more to come. I&#39;ll
throw the patch notes below and I&#39;ll write up on what I&#39;ve been working
on related to it, mostly for fun and for posterity.</p>

<p>Plus feel free to comment. I doubt anyone will actually download it but
heck, it&#39;d be cool to just give it a try and all this is really just to
learn how the heck all this stuff works. Shout out to Dr. Ken Pu for
giving me the idea to give this a go.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>What I&#39;ve been working on today</h2>

<p>I had a friend help me beta test the app and thankfully found an area
where I hard coded the login info using my own credentials for the
school!</p>

<p>Huge security issue for me! I had done it initially for testing so that
I didn&#39;t have to type in everything by hand every time but forgot to
disable it and even more so I forgot to add the dialog for
username/password.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.objectivetruth.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/login_hardcode.png" alt="login\_hardcode"></p>

<p>I laughed and cried when I saw this... ah sheeeeeet</p>

<p>Another major ongoing issue is getting rid of Jsoup (html parser) in my
code as much as possible as I voiced my frustration in the other post(I
hate Jsoup)</p>

<p>After checking the DDMS (debugging toolkit for android) i saw that 85%
of the time was spend in the method Jsoup.parse(htmldocument.html). I
completely cut the code out and went from average 8 seconds refresh time
to just under 3 seconds.</p>

<p>MEGA improvement and doesn&#39;t impact user experience very much. Now just
gotta find ways of hiding it from the user: a friend commented that if I
put in a confirmation dialog box and start the fetch right away, by the
time the user presses confirm or dismiss on the dialog box (usually 1-2
seconds) the operation is almost done and to the user experience the app
will feel more responsive.. seems contrived but may work? I have to test
it.</p>

<p>Last thing I&#39;ve been spending time on is getting an image to span the
entire background on a grid view. I thought I&#39;d have to chunk the image
down per gridview item but nope, just throw the background around the
entire entry in the xml and you&#39;re golden:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">    android:id=&quot;@+id/calendar_gridview_actual&quot;
    android:layout_width=&quot;1100dp&quot;
    android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;
    android:padding=&quot;0dp&quot;
    android:background=&quot;@drawable/ic_freddie_success&quot;
    &gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>I got it working with hilarious results!</p>

<h2>Patch Notes (v0.52)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>More Stability Improvements, shouldn&#39;t crash at all switching between screens while refreshing. Will give you a soft pop up when the refresh is done though, even if you leave the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Added confirm screen for booking a room</p></li>
<li><p>Still playing with the icons and formatting for the calendar screen.. not a big fan of the green check marks but I&#39;m not quite sure what else to use, hopefully adding a background will live it up. Don&#39;t worry opacity will be low</p></li>
<li><p>Removed Jsoup dependancies when booking a room for increase performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Formatting issues with certain fonts have been fixed, mostly with booking a room and joining a room</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>It looks like you can cancel loading tasks, but i haven&#39;t implemented it as yet, if you cancel it, it will continue</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s an issue with refreshing when you go from 1 day available to 2 days available. You have to close  and then open the app to fix it, still working on this.</p></li>
<li><p>About still doesn&#39;t work, mostly I don&#39;t know what to put in there, doesn&#39;t take long to make..figure i&#39;d say blah blah blah, I&#39;m a student please download my crappy app, haha.</p></li>
<li><p>Can&#39;t join a previously locked in room or create a new reservation if there is another reservation being attempted in that time slot. Its grayed out so unless you try you won&#39;t notice it</p></li>
</ul>
