Fountain Codes are also called rateless erasure codes. This means there
isn't a fixed number of symbols for the original message. Theoretically
there is an infinite number of symbols that can be used in the original
message and you still only need  a few more symbols to recreate the
original message.

Before rateless erasure codes, there was just erasure codes which was a
type of forward error correction. It was originally pioneered to
transmit information over very noisy or unreliable networks.

In 1950 the first error correction code was developed called the Hamming
code.

The original problem is an interesting one when thinking of a future in
space where information transmitting can be very unreliable.
