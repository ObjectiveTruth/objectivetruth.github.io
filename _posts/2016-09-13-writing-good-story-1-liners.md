As a developers, I want to have a story 1-liner from the BA team...

## Introduction

When writing a story 1-liner, there is a specific format, this is not an accident. 

Each part is there for a reason and helps the person receiving the story know what to do when you're not around.

### Example:

**As Anakin Skywalker**, _I want to shoot a torpedo into the exhaust pipe of the deathstar_, `so that I can disable the deathstar and prevent the destruction of my home planet`

*Principle* - who’s eyes the story is written from

_Task_ - The recommended approach to completing the objective

`Objective` - The overall point of the task

### Why this is important:

The `Objective` is important because it gives the person carrying out the task a direction if the recommended approach(task) can’t be done.

Imagine a combat medic being dropped into a combat zone

**as a medic**, _I want to shoot some bad guys on the way to my friend_, `so that I can save my friend's life`

If the recommended approach of shooting their way to their friend, doesn’t work out, they have a fallback plan of just saving their life using whatever method they deem appropriate. 

Lets say if instead, they can sneak his way to save their friend’s life.
