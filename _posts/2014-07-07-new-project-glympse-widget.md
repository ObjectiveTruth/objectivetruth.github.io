Intro
 I was trying to figure out what a good new project would be for a while
and I came up with a temporary location service I wanted to implement.
Heck i was already starting to code it when a friend linked me to an app
that did literally what I was thinking. Heck even the wire frame matched
for the most part.

This amazing app is called Glympse

Description
 Glympse is the easiest way to safely share your location with someone
in real time. Let others follow your location on a dynamic map. You
choose who can see you and for how long.

No sign-up needed and no new social network to manage. Recipients
receive a link allowing them to view your ETA and location in real-time
for the length of time you choose. When the timer on your Glympse
expires, your location is no longer visible. Best of all, recipients do
not need any special software to view your real-time map. Send a Glympse
via SMS, email, Facebook or Twitter, and recipients can view it using
any web-enabled device.

Features:\
 \* Easy: no sign-up required or friend lists to manage\
 \* Safe: your Glympse automatically expires\
 \* Live: share location in real-time\
 \* Open: share with anyone – no app required to view\
 \* Passive: runs in the background\
 \* Global: works anywhere you have GPS and a data connection

Use Glympse to:\
 \* coordinate a night out with friends\
 \* let your spouse know when you’ll be home from work\
 \* negotiate an extra hour of curfew with your parents\
 \* make sure a loved one knows you are safe while running or cycling\
 \* find family members at a theme park\
 \* provide a courtesy notice & ETA to a client when you are stuck in
traffic\
 \* share a charity run with followers on Facebook or Twitter\
 \* direct emergency personnel to you quickly

Super bummed but undeterred to try something cool I figured why not a
widget to enhance this incredible app. Worst case I learn how to
make/interface with widgets.

I'll be writing some things I've learned along the way and whatever
gotchas I encounter. Enjoy!

Here's the video of what I've done so far

NOTE: I won't be releasing .apks of each version because in hindsight,
releasing source publically isn't the best idea if I want to keep
security up "the more you know!"
