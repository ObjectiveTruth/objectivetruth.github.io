Overall did not enjoy it. I'm probably not the target audience

![Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348198441m/5341009.jpg)

:star::star:

2 out of 5 stars

Should have been called

"Agile development from a tester's perspective"

Really didn't like this book. For the thickness, I was expecting a book about how to test in an Agile project, instead it focused more on how to work in general in an agile project.

Reviews on Amazon said this book was a bit outdated and the new version "More Agile Testing" mentions that the views they had are outdated in this book, but I figure I'd get some nuggets of knowledge.

Overall very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Even if they were new to agile. I'd recommend "Scrum: The art of doing twice the work in half the time" instead.
