##Intro

Not a whole lot of changes that you'd be able to see off the bat. Got a
ton of HUGE bug fixes out of the way though. This is probably the most
stable version yet. I dont think you can break it if you tried. The
exception handlers have exception handlers!

Biggest challenge was fixing the FragmentViewPager Adapter I used to
make the calendar tabs. Essentially you gotta know how the
ViewPagerAdapter works. There's a handy function called OnDataSetChange,
which does all the refresh for you. 

After texting the crap out of all
the compoenents and wondering why it still didn't work, I realize that
my SQLOpenHelper class that is a wrapper for the SQL database was static
and apparently was not sending me an updated version of the database
after it had been updated.

My guess is that because the DBwriting was happening in another thread,
and I was calling GetReadableDatabase, SQLOpenHelper decided to just
give me the safest Database it had which was the slightly old one. 

This meant that evertyime I tried to update the data based on the number of
days, it would use the old data and blow up when it didn't exist. Now I
just pass off a few key variables to get it started and it seems to work
every time.

Sorry for the briefness of the explanation but I'm tired and I'll
probalby do a full write up tommorow. I want to basically get it done
asap. There's 2 things that I want to finish now:

1. About Me page formatted properly with everything I want

2. Tutorial: I'm hoping to use this libray in my project that I found
similar to the android built in tutorial overlay

Anyways, too tired to write a big long thing, here's the patch notes!
i'll throw the build tommorow since honestly you wouldn't notice much of
a difference between this version and the old one.

Cheers!
